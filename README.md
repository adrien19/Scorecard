# ScoreCard

This project is build to track metrics on progress, milestones, budgets, and deadline of on-going projects. The project is currently in develpmennt using Angulat - version 9.1.5.

## Development server

Currently running on local dev server `http://localhost:4200/`. Will be migrated to a hosted server in the future. 

## Project structure
The project is structured such that there could be multiple projects. As of now, only one 'scorecard' project is created. More will be added if need arises in the future. 

## Build

During the current 1st phase of development, the project `ng build` to create the `dist/` for local development. Future development will use angular universal with `npm run build:ssr` for builds and `npm run serve:ssr` for serving the project from a Nodejs server as oppose to static server. 

## Running unit tests

The project will laverage Karma for testing - If interested, you can read more about Karma here -> [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

The project will laverage Protractor for end to end testing - Read more about Protractor here [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
